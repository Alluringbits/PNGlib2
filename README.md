# PNGlib2
Custom  PNG library in C++

## Purpose
This is a custom PNG library made entirely for fun and exercise. It's not meant (as of now) to be fully functional, though it technically can be used.
By no means it is a replacement for official and better PNG libraries. Its aim is to be an efficient, useful, exception-based  clas-based C++ library for PNG images.

The way it is structured is by having a single base PNG class and two derived oPNG (output) and iPNG (input) classes to write or read PNG images. It will be provided with image checking and repairing methods.
